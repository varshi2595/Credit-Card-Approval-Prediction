need pre-processing for status variable -> values are numeric except for no loan or due. X char is present
CNT_CHILDREN as well

riskUsers = ccApproval[ccApproval$TARGET==1,]
nrow(riskUsers)
#0.03 percent users are risk users. need undersampling/oversampling?

preprocessing:

gender
own car
own realty
cnt_children -> change into 3 categories.
education type -> with levels
family status
housing_type
days_birth -> abs(val)/365
days_employed -> abs(val)
job -> check if the categories are limited, if yes change them to factor. else leave it.
status -> chance c to p to make better meaning out of it. p means paid.
begin_months -> abs(val)

###set.seed(123)

#0.03 percent users are risk users. need undersampling/oversampling -> we need to consider this as well.

-> build models decision tree, glm, bayesian, logistic with all variables.
compare the accuracy. (kind of ensemble method). include bagging boosting if needed.

-> since there are only 0.03 percent, we need to do undersampling/oversampling to the actual data.




-> then we'll think of principal component analysis

537667
1962
537667-1962

1962*x = 100000
x=51

x1/537667 = 51
